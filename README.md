### Last status
- analytics functionality has to be done. 
- implemented separate weekly and daily table that can be used
- basic functionality stands
- streak functionality next 
- datetime relativedelta module could be used to track multiple days https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/relativedelta.html#examples
- most functionality could test be done with prompts
- unit test have to be done last
- for the break the habit functionality I need the streak (compare with last date if checked) ✅
